# Changelog Convention

Every commit in this project **must** have a corresponding changelog file.

## File location and naming

- Directory: `changelogs/`
- Filename: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-mm.md` (UTC timestamp of when the change was made)
- Example: `changelogs/2026-02-26_17-34.md`

## File format

```markdown
# <Short title matching the commit message>

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm

## Summary

One-paragraph description of what changed and why.

## Added
- New features, files, or capabilities

## Changed
- Modifications to existing files or behavior

## Fixed
- Bug fixes

## Removed
- Anything deleted or deprecated
```

Only include the sections (Added / Changed / Fixed / Removed) that apply.

## When to create

- Create the changelog file **before** making the git commit, so it is included in the same commit.
- If multiple related changes are committed together, use a single changelog entry.
