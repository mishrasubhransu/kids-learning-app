# Pre-generate full test questions with natural intonation

**Date:** 2026-02-26 19:05

## Summary

Generate complete "Which one is X?" question clips via ElevenLabs so the question intonation sounds natural instead of chaining a flat word after a phrase fragment. Also added a `speakSequence()` helper for back-to-back clip playback used by wrong-answer feedback, and made the generation script skip existing clips to avoid unnecessary regeneration.

## Added
- ~115 pre-generated "Which one is X?" question clips with natural question intonation
- `speakSequence()` method in useSpeech hook for chaining clips back-to-back
- "That was" and "Try to find" phrase clips for wrong-answer feedback
- Skip-existing logic in word clip generation to avoid bloating git

## Changed
- `toAudioKey()` now strips punctuation for clean filenames
- TestingMode uses single `speak()` call for questions (matches full clip), `speakSequence()` for wrong-answer feedback
- `generate-audio.mjs` separates item words from derived questions/phrases
