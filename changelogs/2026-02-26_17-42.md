# fix: Lock pages to viewport to eliminate unwanted scrolling on tablets

**Date:** 2026-02-26 17:42

## Summary

Locked the app layout to the viewport so kids cannot scroll the page with a single finger on tablets. Pages now fill exactly the screen height, with only the TileView grid allowing internal scrolling for content that overflows.

## Changed
- Set `html`, `body`, and `#root` to `height: 100%; overflow: hidden` in global CSS
- Switched all page containers from `min-h-screen` to `h-full overflow-hidden`
- Added `overflow-y-auto` to TileView for internal scrolling of tile grids
