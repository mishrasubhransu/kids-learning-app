# Use ElevenLabs voice for learning item pronunciation

**Date:** 2026-02-26 18:30

## Summary

Pre-generate audio clips for all learning items (alphabets, numbers, colors, shapes, objects) using the same ElevenLabs Laura voice used for feedback, so pronunciation sounds consistent across all platforms. The speech hook now plays these clips when available and falls back to browser TTS for dynamic phrases. Also fixes iOS/iPadOS reading single uppercase letters as "capital A" etc.

## Added
- Pre-generated ElevenLabs word audio clips for all 115 learning items in `public/audio/words/`
- Manifest file (`manifest.json`) listing all available word clips
- `--words-only` and `--feedback-only` flags for `generate-audio.mjs`
- `useSpeech` hook loads manifest on mount and plays pre-generated audio when available

## Changed
- `generate-audio.mjs` refactored into `generateFeedbackClips()` and `generateWordClips()` functions
- `useSpeech.js` rewritten to prefer pre-generated ElevenLabs audio, falling back to browser TTS
- Browser TTS fallback normalizes single uppercase letters to lowercase for iOS compatibility
