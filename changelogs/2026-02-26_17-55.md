# fix: Remove browser TTS fallback to prevent duplicate audio

**Date:** 2026-02-26 17:55

## Summary

Browser TTS was firing alongside pre-recorded MP3 audio, causing overlapping speech on iPad. Removed the browser speech synthesis fallback entirely so only ElevenLabs MP3 files are used. Also ensured the audio manifest is fully loaded before attempting playback to prevent race conditions.

## Changed
- `playOne` now awaits the audio manifest before deciding playback source

## Removed
- Browser speech synthesis (TTS) fallback from `useSpeech` hook
- `voicesLoaded` state and voice loading effect
