# fix: Speak first item name when entering scroll pages

**Date:** 2026-02-26 17:45

## Summary

When entering a scroll page (alphabets, numbers, colors, etc.), the first item's name was not spoken aloud. Users had to press an arrow key before hearing any speech. Now the current item name is announced immediately on page entry.

## Fixed
- Scroll pages now speak the first item name as soon as the page loads
