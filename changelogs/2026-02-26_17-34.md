# fix: Prevent accidental zoom and long-press issues on tablets

**Date:** 2026-02-26 17:34

## Summary

Added touch-friendly CSS and viewport settings to prevent kids from accidentally zooming, panning, or triggering context menus on iPad and Android tablets.

## Fixed
- Accidental pinch-to-zoom and double-tap zoom via viewport meta and `touch-action: manipulation`
- Page bouncing/pull-to-refresh with `overscroll-behavior: none`
- Long-press context menus and text selection triggered by kids' longer taps
- iOS text size auto-adjustment on rotation
- Distracting tap highlight flash on touch
