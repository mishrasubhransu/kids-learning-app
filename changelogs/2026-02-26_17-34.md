**Date:** 2026-02-26 17:34

## Summary

Added a new "Objects" learning mode to the landing page (after Shapes). Objects contains five sub-categories — Animals, Birds, Food, Transportation, and Professions — each with photorealistic AI-generated images and full support for Scroll, Tile, and Test modes.

## Added

- **Objects landing page** (`ObjectsHome.jsx`) — sub-category picker with colorful cards
- **5 object categories** with 66 total items:
  - Animals (21): Lion, Tiger, Dog, Cat, Pig, Rhino, Hippo, Horse, Donkey, Zebra, Sheep, Goat, Llama, Camel, Elephant, Alligator, Gorilla, Chimpanzee, Orangutan, Monkey, Deer
  - Birds (13): Peacock, Crow, Pigeon, Hen, Rooster, Turkey, Parrot, Sparrow, Duck, Swan, Ostrich, Eagle, Vulture
  - Food (12): Pizza, Burger, Dosa, Vada, Rice, Ice Cream, French Fries, Fish, Pasta, Yogurt, Soup, Kebab
  - Transportation (10): Bicycle, Electric Scooter, Moped, Motorcycle, Car, Truck, Bus, Train, Aeroplane, Rocket
  - Professions (10): Doctor, Surgeon, Software Engineer, Scientist, Mechanic, Teacher, Pilot, Air Hostess, Athlete, Chauffeur
- **Image generation script** (`scripts/generate_object_images.py`) — batch generates photorealistic images via Gemini, auto-resizes to 512x512 WebP (~30KB each) for fast loading, with category-specific prompts, CLI flags (`--category`, `--item`, `--force`), and resume support
- **66 AI-generated images** in `public/objects/<category>/` (WebP format, ~2.2MB total)
- **Data file** (`src/data/objects.js`) — category metadata and item definitions

## Changed

- `TileView.jsx` — added default case for rendering image tile cards
- `TestingMode.jsx` — added default case for image-based test options
